<h1>Step-by-Step Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
<b>EDA</b> is a technique primarily used to see what data can reveal the hidden story and provides a better understanding of dataset variables and the relationships between them.

Some techniques and statistical functions thata can be perform with EDA tools include:

   - Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical 
      displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.
      
   - Univariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.
    
   - Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess 
      the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable youâ€™re looking at.
    
   - Multivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data.

In this notebook, I tried to cover all the EDA steps to approach any new dataset with logial explenation.


I used four dataset: <br>
<ol>
<li>   Titanic dataset (taken from kaggle)</li>
<li>   Iris dataset (inbulit dataset from seaborn library)</li>
<li>   Flights dataset (inbulit dataset from seaborn library)</li>
<li>   Tips dataset (inbulit dataset from seaborn library)</li>
</ol>
